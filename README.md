Created in Fall 2016 to test some limits of Windows Application Forms while I was taking a C# class.

I made this program for fun just to test if I could fully control what happens when someone closes windows in different ways.  It's useful to know for future projects so I could run shutdown code, like auto-saving.  This one in particular opens 2 more windows when 1 is closed.  Inspiration was the Hydra from mythology where when 1 head is cut off, 2 more grow.  Exiting the program another way will end the program and show a count of "heads" cut off, and all the windows close.
